<h2>Im Clint a GBC Interaction Design Student.</h2>
      <p>Ive been specializing in design since my frist year of highschool (which wasnt long ago)
      I graduated with Honours in the specialized Cyber Arts Program they granted there and did
      that for the enitrey of 4 years of highschool (I did some engineering as well). I also graduated
      with a SHSM (Specialist High Skills Major) which gave me a shiny red seal on my diploma. And as
      fancy as all of that sounds, I dont think it gives me a edge in the "real world". Interaction
      Design wasnt my first program of choice, I used to be in the Game Design Program at GBC. However
      due to personal difficulties I ended up failing. So I used my time off to decide on a new career
      path and found out about this program being offered at GBC.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Im definetly better off then I was when I started and hope to excel in this course to further my
      career in design. Ive told myslef that I want to become the Gordon Ramsay of design and I am
      completly set on achieving that goal!</p>
      <br>

      Game Design (on my own time), 3D Art and Rendering, and 3D Modelling, and Anime!</p>
